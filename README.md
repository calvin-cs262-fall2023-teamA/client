# CalvinFinds Client
This is the client application for the CalvinFinds project.

The app currently contains a login page and a main page.
- The login page contains fields for entering a username/password and buttons to "log in" or "sign up" (sign up button is currently non-functional).
- The "log in" button will navigate to the main page if the username "edom" and password "password" are entered.
- The main page contains a list of lost/found items (based on a set of data used as a placeholder). The cards for these items currently lack detail (pictures, titles, descriptions, etc.).
- The main page also includes a (currently non-functional) search bar.
